Certainly! Here's another example of a new table with relationships to existing tables in the Northwind database:

Table: ProductReviews

Columns:
ReviewID (Primary Key, unique identifier for the review)
ProductID (Foreign Key referencing the Products table)
CustomerID (Foreign Key referencing the Customers table)
ReviewDate (date, date when the review was submitted)
Rating (integer, rating given by the customer)
ReviewText (text, text content of the review)
This "ProductReviews" table allows customers to submit reviews for specific products in the Northwind database. It captures details such as the product reviewed, the customer who submitted the review, the review date, the rating given, and the text content of the review.

To create the "ProductReviews" table and establish the relationships, you can execute the following SQL queries:

```csharp
CREATE TABLE ProductReviews (
    ReviewID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ProductID INT,
    CustomerID VARCHAR(10),
    ReviewDate DATE,
    Rating INT,
    ReviewText VARCHAR(1000),
    FOREIGN KEY (ProductID) REFERENCES Products (ProductID),
    FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers (CustomerID)
);

```

This creates the "ProductReviews" table with foreign key constraints referencing the "Products" and "Customers" tables. The ProductID column references the ProductID column in the Products table, and the CustomerID column references the CustomerID column in the Customers table.

With this table in place, customers can submit reviews for specific products, and you can query and analyze the reviews data based on product and customer information.

Remember to adapt the table and column names to match the conventions and requirements of your specific database implementation if necessary.
