Certainly! Here's an example of a new business-related table that you could add to the Northwind database:

Table: SalesPromotions

Columns:
PromotionID (Primary Key, unique identifier for the promotion)
PromotionName (text, name of the promotion)
StartDate (date, start date of the promotion)
EndDate (date, end date of the promotion)
Description (text, description of the promotion)
DiscountPercentage (decimal, percentage discount offered in the promotion)
This "SalesPromotions" table can be used to store information about different sales promotions or discounts offered by the company. It allows you to track the details of each promotion, such as the name, start date, end date, description, and the discount percentage applied during the promotion.

You can create this table in the Northwind database by executing the following SQL query:

```csharp
CREATE TABLE SalesPromotions (
    PromotionID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    PromotionName VARCHAR(100),
    StartDate DATE,
    EndDate DATE,
    Description VARCHAR(255),
    DiscountPercentage DECIMAL(5, 2)
);

```

Once the table is created, you can perform various database operations such as inserting, updating, and querying sales promotions data based on your business needs.

Remember to adapt the table structure and column definitions to match your specific business requirements, if necessary.
